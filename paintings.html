      <p class="aboutlan"><span>About</span> <br/> This oil painting was my first artwork piece. I painted it two weeks after the first class of oil painting. It was in an art class and the professor didn't tell us what this painting exactly looks like. I assume it was because he didn't want to scare us since it's our first artwork. So we traced the black and white at the beginning. We traced the shape of a triangle and then the picture got more clear. </p>

      <p class="aboutani"><span>About</span> <br/> This oil painting was from my former photo manipulation design. I liked the photo very much and then decided to paint it myself. This painting challenged me a lot becasue it was a bit hard to draw the animals in oil paintings. But I like the sunset-ish sky and I had a lot of fun painting it. Also, it would be fun if I design the same painting by using a web design tool in the future. </p>
